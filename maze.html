	<p>The maze generator project above demonstrates backtracking algorithm.</br>
	Starting out with a grid full of cells, it will generally begin at the first cell.
	While making the maze there is a moving green square that it going to each square
	starting from the top left of the screen and moves on to a random cell the next 
	move creating the maze. If it gets stuck or hits a dead end it will go back to the
	last square and finds a path to get to the cells that haven't yet been filled. After
	all cells are filled and a maze covers the grid it will then begin the solve the maze
	and find the shortest, quickest route to the other end.
